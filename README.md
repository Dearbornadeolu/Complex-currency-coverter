# Steps to use 
add a Chrome extension after cloning the codes from Github:

Open Google Chrome browser on your computer.

Type "chrome://extensions/" in the address bar and press Enter.

Enable the "Developer mode" option in the top right corner of the page.

Click on the "Load unpacked" button that appears after enabling Developer mode.

Navigate to the directory where you cloned the extension codes from Github and select the folder containing the extension files.

Click the "Select Folder" button to load the extension into Google Chrome.

The extension should now be added to your browser. You can test the extension by using it or checking its settings.

Note: If you have any issues with adding the extension, make sure to check if the code is compatible with your version of Chrome and that you have all the necessary permissions to install and run extensions.
